### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Private reporting

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by creating a [private security advisory](https://github.com/liusir2606/logic-ide/security/advisories/new).

Alternatively, you can email us directly at:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions
- Any potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 4. Response timeline

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- Coordinate disclosure timelines

### 5. Responsible disclosure

We request that you:
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we've had a chance to fix it
- Do not access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
